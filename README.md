 Thrust Stand Project - Summary
ðŸ”§ What I Have Done:
Designed a Thrust Stand to measure the thrust produced by motors (used in drones, rockets, etc.).
*Used EasyEDA to design the electronic circuit:
*Circuit includes Load Cell, HX711 amplifier, and Arduino.
*Simulated the working of the sensor and connections before hardware setup.

Connected and Calibrated Load Cell:
*Load Cell measures force (thrust) generated by motor.
*HX711 converts analog signal to digital for Arduino to read.
*Calibrated using known weights for accurate readings.

What I Learned and Applied:
*How thrust works in real systems.
*Using Load Cell and HX711 for measurement.
*Circuit designing in EasyEDA.
